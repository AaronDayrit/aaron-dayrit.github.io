                            <p>Web communications can often be unsafe. Your information is the prime target of most
                                cybercriminals, and it's important to be secure. To be secure is to be protected from
                                anything that can cause harm to you and your data; this could be a vulnerability or an
                                attack. </p>
                        </div>

                        <h3>Communication Encryption</h3>

                        <p>Encryption is the primary way of keeping information inaccessible to unwanted criminals.
                            Encryption converts plaintext into an unreadable format(cyphertext). Because of encryption,
                            sensitive information communicated by users and servers have an extra layer of protection
                            against criminals. Even when accessed, the data will stay encrypted or unreadable.</p>

                        <h4>SSL</h4>
                        <p>
                            SSL (Secure Socket Layer) is used to establish secure communications between networked
                            computers. It's a protocol that creates an encrypted link between the networked devices to
                            keep information protected. SSL uses explicit connections to encrypt data transferred; This
                            is manually enabled by the via command.
                        </p>

                        <h4>TLS</h4>
                        <p>
                            TLS (Transport Layer Security) is the successor to SSL. TLS is the modern version of SSL
                            used most recommended for transferring data. It uses implicit connections to automatically
                            enable SSL encryption at all times after an established connection.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Common Webpage Security</h3>
                        <p>
                            There are more malicious websites than there are legitimate. Recent years have proven that
                            malicious websites have been bridging the gap to look more believable. That's why it's
                            important to distinguish the difference with various key points.
                        </p>

                        <h4>HTTP</h4>
                        <p>
                            HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol) is a protocol used for transferring resources. Web
                            communication was the purpose of HTTP between web browsers and servers. All data transmitted
                            by HTTP is not encrypted. Because of this flaw, intercepting data was often easy and common.
                            HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure) works as an extension to HTTP. HTTPS encrypts
                            information with TLS encryption. HTTPS both encrypts website requests and responses
                            automatically using TLS encryption. HTTPS-enabled websites have lock icons on search bars of
                            most web browsers. The website prefix will also be present at the beginning of the URL,
                            whether it's HTTP or HTTPS.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Website Policies</h3>
    
                            <p> 
                                Laws in various countries like Australia and Canada have been requiring websites to
                                establish their policies. Website privacy policies are a specific section of a website that
                                indicates what data the webpage collects from you. These policies show that a website is
                                complying with the laws provided by countries. Around the world, countries' precautions to
                                policies may vary with the information required, so it's still a good idea to keep an open
                                mind.
