                                has stood a chance. So we send upon them, only you, Slayer. That is your purpose.

                            Before you even begin to think about playing the game, get a device capable of running it.
                            Doom has a long history of being well optimized on a wide range of devices. These are the
                            minimum specs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are extra precautions you can take if your scenario is extreme or you are stubborn. If
                            you plan on playing the game on integrated graphics, it's possible with some adjustments
                            through the in-game console. Here's a tutorial if you are interested.

                            BASICS
                         -------------------------------------->

                        <h3>Basics</h3>

                        <h4>Movement</h4>
                        <p>
                            Doom is all about speed, and you need to take advantage of yours. <span
                                class="bolded-text">Strafing</span> in a circular
                            motion around enemies is extremely useful in the beginning levels. Using this lateral speed
                            allows you to avoid incoming projectiles.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You get a <span class="bolded-text">double jump</span> by default. The jump is another way
                            to avoid incoming projectiles,
                            enemies and cover ground vertically. Often beginners stick themselves to the ground causing
                            hordes of enemies to pile.
                        </p>

                        <p class="bolded-text">You have limited vision, and you don't have eyes at the back of your
                            head. Get out of the way
                            before they have the chance.</p>

                        <h3>Weapons:</h3>
                        <p>
                            Each weapon in this game has its quirk and purpose. You use each of the guns in two ways.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Primary Fire</h4>
                        <p>
                            The primary fire is through your standard shoot button on your mouse/controller. This can be
                            a simple shotgun blast or automatic rifle shot.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Weapon mod/secondary fire</h4>
                        <p>
                            The weapon mod is through your secondary-fire button on your mouse/controller. These mods
                            are unique to each weapon and enhance its utility. They range from a shield that blocks all
                            projectiles or a beam that can stun a demon in place.They are obtained through <span
                                class="bolded-text">field drones</span>
                            found around a level.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Glory-kills</h4>
                        <p>
                            A glory-kill is a violent finisher done to an enemy at low health. Glory-kills <span
                                class="bolded-text">replenish you health</span>. You are alerted of a glory kill when an
                            enemy begins to flash blue. From there,
                            you choose to finish the enemy through a button assigned to glory-kill. You have a limited
                            time to act.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Chainsaw</h4>
                        <p>
                            The chainsaw is a tool. You use it to <span class="bolded-text">replenish your ammo</span>.
                            "Chainsawing" an enemy will also
                            give you a brief window of invisibility to clear you from danger. Chainsaw fuel regenerates
                            over time for one charge. Picking up more fuel allows you to use the chainsaw on bigger
                            demons. The chainsaw is the primary way to replenish ammo.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Weapon types</h3>

                        <h4>Combat Shotgun:</h4>

                        <p>
                            The combat shotgun is your starting weapon. It has a short range, weak damage, and a very
                            high bullet spread.
                        </p>

                        <p class="indented-paragraph">
                            Sticky bombs convert standard shotgun pellets into explosive <span class="bolded-text">AOE

                        </p>

                        <h5>Tips:</h5>
                        <p>
                            Try using the sticky bombs as a replacement for the primary fire. They reload fast and
                            consume the same amount of ammo.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Use the full auto as a high damage dealer early game. It can deal very high damage to a
                            <span class="bolded-text">heavy demon</span> up close.
                        </p>

                        </p>

                        <h5>Tips:</h5>

                        <p>
                            When the combat shotgun's sticky bombs are reloading, switch to the primary fire of the
                            heavy cannon to continue the damage early game.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Grenade Launcher: </h4>

                        <p class="image-description">-Shoulder mounted grenade launcher</p>


                        <p>On your shoulder is a grenade launcher that replenishes grenades over time. It's mounted on
                            your shoulder, meaning you can shoot a grenade while shooting your weapons.</p>

                        <h5>Tips:</h5>

                        <p>
                            The grenades cause a <span class="bolded-text">falter</span>. This stuns a demon for an
                            <span class="bolded-text">opening</span> to attack.

                           DEMON TYPES
                         -------------------------------------->

                        <h3>Demon types:</h3>

                        <p>On the first level (Hell on Earth), there are <span class="bolded-text">seven demon
                                types</span> and <span class="bolded-text">three enemy categories:</span></p>

                        <h4>Fodder demon</h4>

                        <p>Fodder enemies are demons used in hordes to harass the player. More importantly, fodder
                            demons only require <span class="bolded-text">one chainsaw fuel</span> to kill. They are
                            your primary <span class="bolded-text">ammo source</span> when
                            running low.</p>

                        <h5>Zombie</h5>
                            
                        <div class="small-container">
                            <img src="assets/images/guide/half1.png">
                        </div>
            
                        <p>
                            Zombies are the weakest enemies in the games: They move slowly and melee you up close.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Imp</h5>

                        <div class="small-container">
                            <img src="assets/images/guide/half2.png">
                        </div>
         
                        <p>
                            Imps are extremely volatile. They can run, climb and jump. They <span
                                class="bolded-text">pummel you up close</span> and have
                            a strong projectile with <span class="bolded-text">pinpoint accuracy</span>.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Soldier (blaster)</h5>

                        <div class="small-container">
                            <img src="assets/images/guide/half3.png">
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            Soldiers are very slow but make up for it with constant automatic projectiles.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Gargoyle</h5>

                        <div class="small-container">
                            <img src="assets/images/guide/half4.png">
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            Gargoyles are as fast as imps, with wings attached to their back. Gargoyles often stay on
                            the ground but prefer to harass you up close. At a far ranch, they hover in the air and
                            charge for a barrage of projectiles.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Ambient demon</h4>

                        <p>
                            Ambient enemies are stationary enemy types.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Tentacle</h5>

                        <div class="small-container">
                            <img src="assets/images/guide/half5.png">
                        </div>
                        <p>
                            Going up close to a tentacle spawn will cause one to sprout. It will have a brief window to
                            attack you and to be attacked.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Heavy demon</h4>

                        <p>
                            Heavy enemies are much stronger enemy types. They have a bigger arsenal and have more
                            health. To chainsaw a heavy enemy, you need <span class="bolded-text">three chainsaw
                                fuel</span>.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Arachnotron:</h5>
                        <div class="small-container">
                            <img src="assets/images/guide/half6.png">
                        </div>

                        <p>
                            Arachnotrons are the highest priority targets at early levels. They prefer to attack from
                            range with fast-firing projectiles and grenades.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Weakness:</h6>

                        <p class="indented-paragraph">
                            <span class="bolded-text">Destroying the turret</span> on its head causes the Arachnotron to
                            attack closer and without most of its projectiles.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Cacodemon</h5>
                        <div class="small-container">

                        <p>
                            Cacodemons are flying meatballs that shoot fast-firing projectiles and a powerful bite up
                            close.
                        </p>

                        <h6>Weakness:</h6>

                        <p class="indented-paragraph">
                            Shooting a <span class="bolded-text">sticky bomb or grenade</span> causes a cacodemon to go
                            into a glory-kill state.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Other/Advanced techniques.</h3>

                        <p>These techniques aren't necessary but are extra components to enhance your experience with
                            the game.</p>

                        <h4>Faltering system</h4>

                        <p>
                            Faltering is the most important system in the game. Faltering is a stun, dealt to an enemy
                            through a specific action. When killing higher-tier demons, it's efficient <span
                                class="bolded-text">to falter</span> them
                            for an opening to allow a safer kill.
                        </p>

                        <h5>Falter causes (early game):</h5>

                        <ul>

                                There is no clear-cut way to run through Doom. It's built from the ground up with a
                                challenge in mind. This game doesn't cater to you. You have to cater to it. It's up to

                                to learn the game's mechanics and master them.
