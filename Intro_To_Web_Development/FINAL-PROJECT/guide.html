                                Earth is in shambles due to the invasion of Hell's forces. No army, no legion, no human
                                has stood a chance. So we send upon them, only you, Slayer. That is your purpose.

                            for its difficulty.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You've come to the right place. To kill the demons, you must first need to learn how. This
                            guide will cover basic information for the average beginner. All this will get you through
                            your first level on "Hurt Me Plenty" difficulty or medium mode.

                            Before you even begin to think about playing the game, get a device capable of running it.
                            Doom has a long history of being well optimized on a wide range of devices. These are the
                            minimum specs.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            There are extra precautions you can take if your scenario is extreme or you are stubborn. If
                            you plan on playing the game on integrated graphics, it's possible with some adjustments
                            through the in-game console. Here's a tutorial if you are interested.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            If you are planning to play on a console, you're in luck. All current-gen consoles are
                            easily able to run the game.
                        </p>

                        <h3>Basics</h3>
                        <p></p>
                        <h4>Movement</h4>
                        <p>
                            Doom is all about speed, and you need to take advantage of yours. Strafing in a circular
                            motion around enemies is extremely useful in the beginning levels. Using this lateral speed
                            allows you to avoid incoming projectiles.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            You get a double jump by default. The jump is another way to avoid incoming projectiles,
                            enemies and cover ground vertically. Often beginners stick themselves to the ground causing
                            hordes of enemies to pile.
                        </p>

                        <p>You have limited vision, and you don't have eyes at the back of your head. Get out of the way
                            before they have the chance.</p>

                        <h3>Weapons:</h3>
                        <p>
                            Each weapon in this game has its quirk and purpose. You use each of the guns in two ways.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Primary Fire</h4>
                        <p>
                            The primary fire is through your standard shoot button on your mouse/controller. This can be
                            a simple shotgun blast or automatic rifle shot.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Weapon mod/secondary fire</h4>
                        <p>
                            The weapon mod is through your secondary-fire button on your mouse/controller. These mods
                            are unique to each weapon and enhance its utility. They range from a shield that blocks all
                            projectiles or a beam that can stun a demon in place.They are obtained through field drones
                            found around a level.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Glory-kills</h4>
                        <p>
                            A glory-kill is a violent finisher done to an enemy at low health. Glory-kills replenish
                            your health. You are alerted of a glory kill when an enemy begins to flash blue. From there,
                            you choose to finish the enemy through a button assigned to glory-kill. You have a limited
                            time to act.
                        </p>

                        <h4>Chainsaw</h4>
                        <p>
                            The chainsaw is a tool. You use it to replenish your ammo. "Chainsawing" an enemy will also
                            give you a brief window of invisibility to clear you from danger. Chainsaw fuel regenerates
                            over time for one charge. Picking up more fuel allows you to use the chainsaw on bigger
                            demons. The chainsaw is the primary way to replenish ammo.
                        </p>
